The `stantargets` R package is an extension to
[`targets`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) and
[`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr) for Bayesian data
analysis. `stantargets` makes it super easy to set up useful scalable
Stan pipelines that automatically parallelize the computation and skip
expensive steps when the results are already up to date. Minimal custom
code is required, and there is no need to manually configure branching,
so usage is much easier than
[`targets`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) alone. `stantargets` can
access all of [`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr)â€™s major
algorithms (MCMC, variational Bayes, and optimization) and it supports
both single-fit workflows and multi-rep simulation studies.

## Installation

Install the GitHub development version to access the latest features and
patches.

``` r
remotes::install_github("wlandau/stantargets")
```

The [`cmdstan`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan) command line
interface is also required.

``` r
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

## Documentation

The `stantargets` website at <https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/>
has function documentation and vignettes. Prior familiarity with
[`targets`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) and
[`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr) is highly
recommended, and you can learn more at
<https://wlandau.github.io/targets> and <https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/>,
respectively.
