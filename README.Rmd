The `stantargets` R package is an extension to [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) and [`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr) for Bayesian data analysis. `stantargets` makes it super easy to set up useful scalable Stan pipelines that automatically parallelize the computation and skip expensive steps when the results are already up to date. Minimal custom code is required, and there is no need to manually configure branching. `stantargets` can access all of [`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr)'s major algorithms (MCMC, variational Bayes, and optimization) and it supports both single-fit workflows and multi-rep simulation studies.

## How it works

`stantargets` supports specialized [target factories](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/02/03/targets/#target-factories) that create ensembles of [target objects](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_target.html) for [`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr) workflows. These [target factories](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/02/03/targets/#target-factories) abstract away the details of [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) and [`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr) and make both packages easier to use. For details, please read the [vignette on non-branching MCMC pipelines](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/articles/mcmc.html).

## Prerequisites

1. The [prerequisites of the `targets` R package](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/index.html#prerequisites).
1. Basic familiarity with [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/): watch minutes 6 through 40 of [this video](https://youtu.be/Gqn7Xn4d5NI), then read [this chapter](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html) of the [user manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/).
1. Familiarity with Bayesian Statistics and [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/). Prior knowledge of [`cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) helps.

## How to get started

Read the `stantargets` tutorial vignettes [here](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/articles/mcmc.html) and [here](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/articles/mcmc_rep.html), then use <https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/> as a reference while constructing your own workflows.

## Installation

Install the GitHub development version to access the latest features and patches.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("wlandau/stantargets")
```

The [CmdStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan) command line interface is also required.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

If you have problems installing [CmdStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan), please consult the [installation guide of `cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) and the [installation guide of CmdStan](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_26/cmdstan-guide/cmdstan-installation.html). Alternatively, the [Stan discourse](https://discourse.mc-stan.org) is a friendly place to ask Stan experts for help.

## Usage

First, write a [`_targets.R` file](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html) that loads your packages, defines a function to generate [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) data, and lists a pipeline of targets. The target list can call target factories like [`tar_stan_mcmc()`](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/reference/tar_stan_mcmc.html) as well as ordinary targets with [`tar_target()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_target.html).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# _targets.R
library(targets)
library(stantargets)

generate_data <- function() {
  true_beta <- stats::rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  x <- seq(from = -1, to = 1, length.out = n)
  y <- stats::rnorm(n, x * true_beta, 1)
  list(n = n, x = x, y = y, true_beta = true_beta)
}

list(
  tar_stan_mcmc(example, "x.stan", generate_data())
)
```

Run [`tar_visnetwork()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_visnetwork.html) to check `_targets.R` for correctness, then call [`tar_make()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_make.html) to run the pipeline. Access the results using [`tar_read()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_read.html), e.g. `tar_read(tar_read(example_summary_x)`. Visit [this vignette](https://wlandau.github.io/stantargets/articles/mcmc.html) to read more about this example.
